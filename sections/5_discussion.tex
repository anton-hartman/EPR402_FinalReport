\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Critical evaluation of the design}

\subsubsection{Interpretation of results}
\paragraph{Laser turret}\hfill\\
The laser turret performs well with sufficient feedback frequency. In \autoref{fig:q2_laser_errors}, it can be seen that the laser reaches the target position accurate to within 6 pixels for all tests with one exception. This is accurate to within 1 millimetre of the target position given the measured radii of the laser beam and a known 2 millimetre disc. These measurements indicate that anything within 8 pixels is accurate to within 1 millimetre
